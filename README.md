# ForeSite-Golf-Buddy-App

## Golf-Buddy Webpage
The teams' motivation was to create a webpage application that allows users to search for golf buddies in the Austin area based on three criteria. The three criteria to filter out results for golf partners consists of gender, playstyle (relaxed or competitive), and handicap. Users wil create an account by creating an username and password. Then users will also create a playercard that contains their attributes (gender, handicap, playstyle). The technologies used inside the webpage included 2 server APIs (Weather and Socket.io), incorporated Tailwind CSS, JS, HTML, MySQL, node.js, express.js, handlebars.js, and finally Github. In order to accomplish this goal the following problems must have been solved:

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
* Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.
* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.
* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
* Have a polished UI.
* Be responsive.
* Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
* Meet good-quality coding standards.
* Have a professional README.

## Usage
This is to allows users of the webpage to match with compatable golfers based on their own preferences.
